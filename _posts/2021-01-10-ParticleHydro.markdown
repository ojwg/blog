# Disk Feedback
Preliminary hydro+particle sim with a rudimentary feedback prescription.  
Energy is injected assuming a SN rate of $$10^{51} \mathrm{erg}/100\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$$ released over $$10\mathrm{Myr}$$.
Mass is injected assuming that each SN releases $$10\mathrm{M}_\odot$$ of material.

## X-Z Temperature and Density

Gas temperature at $$800$$ kyr along a x-z slice through the disk.

Gas density at $$800$$ kyr along the same slice.

The evolution of gas temperature along the x-z slice through the disk until $$850$$ kyr.
